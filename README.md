# CSCI235_Programming_Languages

   The course treats a couple of important programming languages, namely C ++ ,
Prolog and Python. We try to teach you how to write good code in each of
these languages, and hope that knowing about different types of programming
languages will help you with choosing the right language for a given problem.
Using the three given languages as example, we will discuss important prop-
erties of programming languages: A language can be either compiled or inter-
preted. It can be statically typed or dynamically typed. It can be imperative,
functional, or logical. An imperative language can have value semantics, or ref-
erence semantics (usually combined with OO). A language can have built-in
memory management (garbage collection), or leave the memory management to
the user.

* **C ++** is a programming language, that offers light-weight abstraction mech-
anisms, which can be efficiently executed on existing hardware. It is com-
piled, mostly statically typed, imperative with value semantics, and leaves
memory management to the user. It is possible to use object orientation
in C ++ , but it is not its main goal.

* **Prolog** is logical, interpreted, and it has built-in memory management. A
program in Prolog is a logical description of the problem. The interpreter
uses this description to search for solutions of the problem. Prolog is very
suitable for search, and it is used in artificial intelligence.

* **Python** is interpreted, dynamically typed, imperative and it has reference
semantics. It has built-in memory management. It supports OO. It has a
big collection of libraries. It is slow but flexible.

In addition to teaching you the important details of the languages, we will try
to teach you how to write good, efficient, and easily readable code in each of
them.
